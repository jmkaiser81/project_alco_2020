# Exploratory Data Analysis of Alcohol Consumption

The analysis was carried out on data containing alcohol consumption
in 193 countries.

The data was sourced from data.worldbank.org; total alcohol consumption per capita (liters of pure alcohol, projected estimates, 15+ years of age), World Health Organization, Global Health Observatory Data Repository ( apps.who.int/ghodata ).


## Overview

The data was obtained from data.worldbank.org, as highlighted earlier. 
I carried out an exploratory data analysis on the consumption of alcohol in 193 countries.
The analysis was centered on the features of the data, and what it communicates. The use of descriptive statistics (which centers on describing data visually or with models) was also employed.
I also employed hypothesis testing to see if there's a significant relationship between beer serving and wine serving in all the countries, and it turned out that there is.
There is also some significant correlation between beer serving and wine serving, and between beer serving and the total litres of pure alcohol.
I visualized the model obtained for the relationship between beer serving and wine serving.
I also visualized the data, utilizing graphs like box plot and scatter plot.


##  Inference

Some inference obtained from the analysis includes:

- Wine and beer servings are related for any given country in the dataset. This means that individuals drinking wine would most likely drink beer, and vice versa.

- There is great correlation between beer servings and the total liters of pure alcohol, indicating that a larger percentage of alcohol served in the countries was obtained from serving beer.  

- Although, probably expected, the total liters of pure alcohol, is greatly explained by the wine, beer, and spirit servings.

- Beer and wine servings explains 27.8% of the data.

- Afghanistan has the lowest alcohol serving, the lowest in beer, wine and spirit served.

- France turned out the highest in wine serving.

- Namibia has the highest beer serving. Greneda has the highest wine spirit serving, and Belarus has the highest total liter of pure alcohol in all servings.


## Glossary

- Hypothesis testing: Hypothesis testing is a statistical method that is used in making statistical decisions using experimental data.

- Null Hypothesis: A null hypothesis is a type of hypothesis used in statistics that proposes that there is no difference between two sets of observed data and measured phenomena.

- Alternate Hypothesis: The alternate hypothesis is an alternative to the null hypothesis.

- Linear regression: Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. One variable is considered to be an explanatory variable, and the other is considered to be a dependent variable.

- Explanatory Data Analysis: In statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics.
